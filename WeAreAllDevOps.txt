We are all Devops

Everyone cares about operations

Operational Thinking
	What does it mean to have something in production?
		it is being monitored
		someone is responsible for it
		it is being maintained
		it is getting real live traffic
	If it moves, graph it
		Can't impact what you don't measure
			using jawbone to track sleep of on-call to see how being on-call affects sleep
	Ownership
		not just shipping
		Availability
		monitoring and alerting
		performance
	Clear, documented procedures
		architecture reviews
			what problem is being solved
			cost/benefit of design
			how design maps to goals
		operability reviews
			how has it been tested
			how will it be launched
			how will it be monitored and maintained
			when is it "done"?

	Doesnt matter how shiny your site is if it is down. It doesn't matter how good your uptime is if your site doesn't solve customers' problems

Helping other people care
	Show them the State of Devops Report
	Let them get to know their ops people
	Have them read "Effective Devops" (plugging her own upcoming book)

Embracing your inner Devop
	What does "We're all in charge of devops" mean?
		communicating
		empathizing
	Do Bootcamps for new hires
		make meaningful contributions
		deep understanding of other teams
		meet new people
		increased empathy
	Designated Ops
		each team has an ops contact
		designated, not dedicated
			those ops have other work
		help teams get up to speed on best practices
		attend team meetings
			identify operational concerns early
			monitor proactively
			introduce operational thinking to other teams
		pair programming
			sharing knowledge both ways
			github.com/etsy/mixer -- randomized pairing of people for two weeks

Movign beyond Devops
	More than the intersection of Dev & Ops
	How do you bring QA into it? How about Security? UX? Marketing? Customer support? etc...

	Jeff Sussna -- Empathy: THe essense of Devops, 2014

	Expanding "Designated X" programs
	Customer-facing rotations
	Don't treat non-engineers as second-class citizens

	No more rockstars
		Focus on soft skills, not just technical ones
			don't hire assholes
		teamwork > individual ego
		technology as a means, not an end
		fewer rockstars, more orchestras

	Keep learning and iterating

Thoughts: A cheerleading-type summary of devops concepts... nice overview. Moving beyond devops section was good
