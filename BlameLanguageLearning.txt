Blame. Language. Learning. Tips for learning from incidents in your org

Failure
	leads to 1) Blame, and 2) Inquiry
	Traditional narrative of blame tends to lead to worse perceptions than reality
	Focused on root cause analysis

	New thinking -- People in (as part of) systems
	embrace fundamental complexity
	look up and out, not down and in

Learning Organizations
	high quality feedback from the front lines
	less defending of decisions

3 factors that inhibit learning
	1) blame
	2) language
	3) sharing (or lack thereof)

Language hacks to minimize blame
	what > how > why > who
	words as framing devices

	why -- fundamentally about justifying actions
		attribution and apportioning of blame
		triggers counterfactuals -- exploring alternate histories that never happened

	we jusdge our actions by the context we are in, but judge others by their personality

	how -- distances people from actions
		good for clarifying technical details
		can limit scope of inquiry

	what -- uncovering reasoning
		builds empathy with people in your system
		encourages explaining in terms of foresight

	assume everyone did the best they could with the information/abilities/etc at the time

	foresight vs hindsight
		hindsight gives distorted view

	Blame -- responsible for failure, neglectful, derelict
		fosters notion of bad apples, malicious actors

		things go right more often than they go wrong
		"What made the course of action the right one?"

Cognitive Biases
	mental shortcut -- brain optimizes for timeliness over accuracy
	probnlem solving -> heuristic -> 1) correct result == rational choice
					 2) incorrect result == cognitive bias

	confirmation bias -- constantly seeking information that reinforces our view of the world
		ignores alternate explanations
		countered by:
			taking opposing viewpoints -- appoint someone to do so, for example
			if your conclusion is negative -- be wary of confirmation bias

	hindsight bias -- memory distortion to form a judgement
		knowing the outcome, rewrite history to make it fit the outcome
		talking about events with the knowledge of the outcome, not knowledge available at the time
		hindsight bias is the cultural killer -- relentlessly eliminate it

		countered by:
			"we're about to launch. what do you think will be about to break?"
			launch
			"now that we've launched, what has just broken?"

			explain in terms of foresight

Sharing
	safe environments -- be the shit umbrella you want to see in the world
	Retrospective Prime Directive
	Navigate gap between "Work as imagined" vs "Work as done"
		often significant chasm
