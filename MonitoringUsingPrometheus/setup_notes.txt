Below, please find materials or downloads needed in advance of your tutorial:

Familiarize yourself with Prometheus. A good starter is the SoundCloud blog 
post: https://developers.soundcloud.com/blog/prometheus-monitoring-at-soundcloud

Next, you should look at the Week of Monitoring blog posts by Boxever: 
http://www.boxever.com/week-of-monitoring-wrapup

Finally, you find comprehensive documentation at Prometheus.io: 
http://prometheus.io/
Bring a Linux or Mac laptop. Optionally, have Linux running in a VM on a 
Mac or on any other platform. Install the most recent binaries for your 
platform:

The Prometheus server: https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases

The Node Exporter. If you have Linux running in a VM, install the node 
exporter there (the node exporter works much better on Linux): 
https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter/releases

An example application to be instrumented will be offered in Go and Python. 
If you prefer Python, make sure you have a working Python development 
environment on your laptop and install the Python client library by running 
"pip install prometheus_client"

If you prefer Go, make sure you have a working Go1.4.x development on your 
machine and clone https://github.com/prometheus/client_golang into 
$GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus/client_golang.

Make sure the following works: 
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/prometheus/client_golang/examples/simple
go get 
go build
