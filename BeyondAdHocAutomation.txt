Beyond Ad-hoc Automation: Leveraging Structured Platforms

Docker in Production Reality, Not Hype
	After you docker all the docker, that's still not enough
	needs fabric
		artisanally crafted bash scripts, chef, whatever

Containerized builds
	runs tests
	creates versioned, deployable artifacts
	standardizes development environment

concourse.ci -- open-source CICD tool from Pivotal for complex, multi-stage pipelines

90% of tech is tribalism and fashion
	use things that there is community support for, so some of that is probably good

Just because you can, doesn't mean you should
	make sure you use the right tool for the job

broken gets fixed, but shitty lives forever

Thoughts: great speaker, funny, informative ,but very high-level talk
